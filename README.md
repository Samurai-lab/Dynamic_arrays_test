# Dynamic_arrays_test
From a two-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array, first the rows were written in random order, then the columns in random order. Write a program that restores the original two-dimensional array from a one-dimensional array if the dimension of the two-dimensional array is known and the elements in it do not repeat.
